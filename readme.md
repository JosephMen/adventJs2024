## What is advent JS ?

Advent Js is a challenge created by Miguel Angel Durán (better know as [Midudev](https://www.twitch.tv/midudev) ) that consist in 24 challenges of logic programming that you can resolve on differents programming languages, now admited JS, TS and Python. They present a christmas context problem that ask for a solution for the problem, we have a sort of difficulties as easy, medium and hard. 

The interesting or the challenging part is that we have a profile and a dashboard where we can find the achieves section that the objective is to get them all, some of these achieves are very dificult to get because we need to manage the 3 languages allowed (JS, TS and Python) and write a very good code quality. 

The code is evaluate automatically by test inside the page, after pass all the test we will get a score out of 5 stars, these are earned in function of how good or code is, the evaluation has aspects as readibility, performance or cognitive complexity.

## Target

The target of this repository is document the process of solution that I can achieve. Improve my level of thinking and the translation to writing clear code and get all the achieves on the page. 

I will use all my knowledge in javascript to create the best code I can imagine.

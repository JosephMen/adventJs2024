Santa Claus 🎅 has received a list of magic numbers that represent gifts 🎁, but some of them are duplicates and must be removed to avoid confusion. Additionally, the gifts must be sorted in ascending order before giving them to the elves.

Your task is to write a function that receives a list of integers (which may include duplicates) and returns a new list without duplicates, sorted in ascending order.
